    2. Try to view in mobile and the navbar menu collapses into a dropdown menu.

3. Contact Form

4. Call-to- Action gold button
    1. Try to select large gold 'email me' call-to-action button and it succesffully opened the 'Contact' page. This call-to-action 'email me' button is            available on both the 'home' page and 'about' page.
